# LazyCoffee framework (developing, do not use)
LazyCoffee framework is a jQuery like MVC framework. Similar as React.js or Vue.js but much more easy to use and intuitive.

## Why another MVC framework?
I know there are a lot of MVC frameworks out there. Like Angular, React, Vue and so on, and they are great.<br>
But those frameworks are make for big structures projects.<br>
In my daily work, most of my projects are small and simple. Those frameworks are overkill for me.<br>
So I make this simple framework to easy my daily job.<br>
If you familiar with jQuery and React.js, you can use this framwork without any trouble.

## Design
This framework is looks like React.js but with some slightly different.

* Included center state manager.
* Can get and set component state directly.
* Invoke component methods directly.
* State must be JSON data.
* All JSX document elements are cached.
* extremely fast.

## todo list
No enough developer in this project right now.
* Sever side render
